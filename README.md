Introduction
In a world where technology keeps improving daily, the field of medical technology has high importance. The more medical technology is upgraded, the more it is possible to make people life easier. About 2 to 3 out of every 1000 child are born with some sort of hearing loss. Due to such issue the sign language has been introduced in order to help people with such deficiency communicate with each other, however, how would people who can’t use sign language communicate with hear Impaired people? AidTech’s Hearing-Impaired Vibrating Bracelet Project aims to use technology to help people communicate with hear-impaired people.

Objectives
The aim of the project is to build a device that can help people communicate with hearing impaired people without the need of knowing sign language. The project consist of two parts, hardware and software, the software part consist of an android application that takes in text or speech and an Arduino software programmed using C++, and for the hardware part it will consist of an Arduino Nano device placed on a bracelet that is will be capable of receiving the speech sent by android application and convert it into vibrations that the hear impaired person will understand depending on the variation of vibrations.
